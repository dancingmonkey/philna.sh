No running site is ever completely finished. This one is no exception.

There is more to build, more to style and more to write. It's a challenge.

Welcome to the new version of my site. The old one was notable for it's long service and disappointing content. It's better left forgotten.

_This site is finished._

So, here's to a fresh site, new writing and a place to experiment with the web.
 I'm quite looking forward to it.
