    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Phil Nash is a developer evangelist for <a href="https://www.twilio.com">Twilio</a>. Sometimes he <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/philnash/">writes code on stage</a> in front of a crowd, praying inside that everything works. Sometimes <a href="https://github.com/philnash/">he writes open source code</a>, which is much less stressful because if it is wrong someone else can correct it. He writes code in <a href="https://twitter.com/philnash">tweets</a> sometimes, but not much fits. He blogs <a href="/blog">here</a> and on the <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/author/phil">Twilio blog</a> and you'll find plenty of code there too. Find out more <a href="/about">about Phil</a>.</p>
